# Final Year Project Tool
This is the tool for my Final Year Project.

## Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/). 
3. Install [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).
4. Install [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).
5. Install [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/).

## How to run
This tool is run via Python at the command line, e.g.

```
python fyp_tool.py Apache
```

Replace `Apache` with whatever file name you want to get predictions for. (The program looks in the `/data` folder)
